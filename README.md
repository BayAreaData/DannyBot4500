# boodoo_ebooks

A turn-key, beginner-friendly, ready-to-deploy implementation of a traditional \_ebooks bot using Mispy's [twitter_ebooks](https://github.com/mispy/twitter_ebooks) library.

## Usage

Create your [Twitter app](https://apps.twitter.com) and generate access tokens with *Read, Write and Direct Messages* privileges.

### Deploy using Papertrail and Cloudinary for persistent files

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/BayAreaData/DannyBot4500/tree/persist-cloudinary)

Put your BOT_NAME, SOURCE_USERNAME, and API secrets into Heroku Config Vars using the web dashboard.

*IF USING CLOUDINARY:* Optionally set the filename of starting corpus (`tweets.csv`, an ebooks json archive, or a plaintext file) and upload via Cloudinary dashboard.

Bob's your uncle.

## TODO:
- This is a mess and needs a total rewrite with actual design  

# DISCLAIMER:
I'm making this because I wrote a two-part tutorial for an older version of the twitter_ebooks gem and my mentions turned into a tech support hellscape for months.  
Please [create issues](https://github.com/BooDoo/ebooks_example/issues) if you have trouble. üôè Please do not tweet at me. üôè
